CPURAM
======

This is not anything revolutionary, but I couldn't find a meter that shows the
CPU & RAM usage together, so I built it.

This little meter stays in the system tray and shows PCs processor and RAM usage
realtime. Right click on the icon for options and click for lerger view.

I also couldn't found a better code sample to generate System Tray Icon image
dynamically, but this could be a better example for others as it doesn't use
a nasty image collection to update the Tray Icon image rather it generates the
image accuratly and pastes into the Tray Icon.

I took help of code of someone from PSC to detect the processor usage, thanks to him.
